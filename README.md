```
git clone https://github.com/danibene/Benesch-D-QLSC612.git

2. Install the required dependencies (it is recommended that you create and activate a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) beforehand)

This notebook was run with ```Python 3.7.6```. A ```requirements.txt``` file in the ```documents``` folder lists all of the packages in the virtual environment with which the ```my_analysis.ipynb``` notebook was run. To download these packages, you can run:

```
pip install -r documents/requirements.txt
```

3. Run the notebook

```
jupyter notebook analysis/my_analysis.ipynb
```
## Expected Output

1. A [txt file](https://github.com/danibene/Benesch-D-QLSC612/blob/master/analysis/summary_partY.txt) ```summary_partY.txt``` containing the results of the regression analysis for partY.

2. A png file with partY plotted against body weight and performance IQ:
