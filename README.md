# Benesch-D-QLSC612

My submission for the QLSC612 practical assignment.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository

This can be done with:

```
git clone https://github.com/danibene/Benesch-D-QLSC612.git
```
Then change the working directory to ```Benesch-D-QLSC612```. 

2. Install the required dependencies (it is recommended that you create and activate a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) beforehand)

This notebook was run with ```Python 3.7.6```. A ```requirements.txt``` file in the ```documents``` folder lists all of the packages in the virtual environment with which the ```my_analysis.ipynb``` notebook was run. To download these packages, you can run:

```
pip install -r documents/requirements.txt
```

3. Run the notebook

```
jupyter notebook analysis/my_analysis.ipynb
```
